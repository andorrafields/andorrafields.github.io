                        <p>
                            I grew up in a family business, doing anything that was needed and learned that hard work 
                            gets things done and earns respect from family and coworkers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I opened a ballroom dance studio, and learned that I could self-direct and build things with my hands.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I opened new restaurants, and while training dozens, 
                            learned I was a skilled communicator and teacher.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I spent a decade at one of the best hotels in the country, and learned that 
                            beauty, detail, and seamless convenience matters as much as functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I grew at an industrial marking and ink manufacturing company, and learned that 
                            process, documentation, testing, and training are the foundation for excellence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few months ago, I overheard someone say that "every job is a sales job," to which 
                            another replied, "every company is a technology company," and realized that today's 
                            most successful companies are the ones with the best tools. It was obvious to me 
                            that I needed to learn how to create and use the tools that would make a real 
                            difference to my team. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After recently completing the Java language full stack program at Tech Elevator, I'm excited 
                            to plunge into the world of technology and hone my skills as a developer while learning 
                            about the plethora of ways that technology is changing our world.
                        </p>
